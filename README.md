# MACHINE_LEARNING_PROJECT_MAIN
•	Employed data processing techniques like validation, normalization and sorting of the given malicious software dataset
•	Designed a decision tree using ID3 algorithm, used different pruning techniques to prune the tree and checked the mean accuracy along with confidence interval using K-fold validation
•	Built and trained a perceptron using all the feature values, tested the model using K-fold validation and plotted a ROC curve to choose the best threshold for the perceptron
•	Constructed an ensemble learning model using decision trees and perceptron to increase the accuracy
